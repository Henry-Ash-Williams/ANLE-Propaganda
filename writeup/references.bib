  abstract  = {We present the results and the main findings of SemEval-2020 Task 11 on Detection of Propaganda Techniques in News Articles. The task featured two subtasks. Subtask SI is about Span Identification: given a plain-text document, spot the specific text fragments containing propaganda. Subtask TC is about Technique Classification: given a specific text fragment, in the context of a full document, determine the propaganda technique it uses, choosing from an inventory of 14 possible propaganda techniques. The task attracted a large number of participants: 250 teams signed up to participate and 44 made a submission on the test set. In this paper, we present the task, analyze the results, and discuss the system submissions and the methods they used. For both subtasks, the best systems used pre-trained Transformers and ensembles.}

  abstract = {Fear appeals are a polarizing issue, with proponents confident in
              their efficacy and opponents confident that they backfire. We
              present the results of a comprehensive meta-analysis
              investigating fear appeals' effectiveness for influencing
              attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. We tested predictions from
              a large number of theories, the majority of which have never been
              tested meta-analytically until now. Studies were included if they
              contained a treatment group exposed to a fear appeal, a valid
              comparison group, a manipulation of depicted fear, a measure of
              attitudes, intentions, or behaviors concerning the targeted risk
              or recommended solution, and adequate statistics to calculate
              effect sizes. The meta-analysis included 127 articles (9\%
              unpublished) yielding 248 independent samples (NTotal = 27,372)
              collected from diverse populations. Results showed a positive
              effect of fear appeals on attitudes, intentions, and behaviors,
              with the average effect on a composite index being random-effects
              d = 0.29. Moderation analyses based on prominent fear appeal
              theories showed that the effectiveness of fear appeals increased
              when the message included efficacy statements, depicted high
              susceptibility and severity, recommended one-time only (vs.
              repeated) behaviors, and targeted audiences that included a
              larger percentage of female message recipients. Overall, we
              conclude that (a) fear appeals are effective at positively
              influencing attitude, intentions, and behaviors; (b) there are
              very few circumstances under which they are not effective; and
              (c) there are no identified circumstances under which they
              backfire and lead to undesirable outcomes.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents the winning solution of the Fragment Level Classification (FLC) task in the Fine Grained Propaganda Detection competition at the NLP4IF{'}19 workshop. The goal of the FLC task is to detect and classify textual segments that correspond to one of the 18 given propaganda techniques in a news articles dataset. The main idea of our solution is to perform word-level classification using fine-tuned BERT, a popular pre-trained language model. Besides presenting the model and its evaluation results, we also investigate the attention heads in the model, which provide insights into what the model learns, as well as aspects for potential improvements.}
